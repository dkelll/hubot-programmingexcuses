## hubot-programmingexcuses


(WORK IN PROGRESS)
A [Hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot) plugin to get a random excuse from [Programming Excuses](http://programmingexcuses.com).

This is a fork of [hubot-codingexcuses](https://github.com/erunion/hubot-codingexcuses) which referenced the codingexcuses.com site. That site had some issues at one point, so I found a similar site and rebuilt the hubot script to use the programmingexcuses.com site.

### Usage

    hubot excuse - Pulls a random excuse from http://programmingexcuses.com
